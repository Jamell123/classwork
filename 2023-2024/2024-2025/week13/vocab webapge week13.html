<p>uniformn Resource loxator (URL)</p>
<p>a text string that specifies the location of a resource on the internet, such as a webpage, image, or video.</p>

<p>firewall</p>
<p> part of a computer system or network which is designed to block unauthorized access while permitting outward communication.</p>


<p>Transmission Control Protocol-Internet Protocol (TCP-IP)</p>
<p>a suite of communication protocols that defines how data is transmitted across networks, particularly the internet, ensuring reliable and ordered delivery of data packets</p>

<p>Network Protocols</p>
<p> established sets of rules that define how data is transmitted and managed between devices on a network, enabling communication </p>

<p>Computer Network</p>
<p> a system of interconnected devices that share data and resources, enabling communication and collaboration through standardized protocols and physical or wireless technologies.</p>

<p>IPv4</p>
<p>the fourth version of the Internet Protocol, a set of rules that govern how data is transmitted over the internet, using a 32-bit address system.</p>

<p>ipv6</p>
<p>the latest version of the Internet protocol, designed to address the issue of IPv4 address depletion by providing a much larger address space, enabling more devices to connect to the internet.</p>

<p>Domain Name Services (DNS)</p>
<p>the internet's directory, translating human-readable domain names (like "google.com") into the numerical IP addresses (like "192.0.2.1") that computers use to communicate.</p>

<p>Hyper-text transfer protocol (HTTP/HTTPS)</p>
<p> the foundation of data exchange on the web, allowing browsers and servers to communicate, while HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP, encrypting data transfer for privacy and security. </p>

<p>cloud computing</p>
<p>he on-demand delivery of computing resources, like servers, storage, databases, networking, and software, over the internet, allowing users to access and use these resources without managing the underlying infrastructure</p>

<p>OSI Model</p>
<P>a conceptual framework that describes how network communication functions are organized into seven distinct layers, providing a standardized way to understand and troubleshoot network interactions.</P>

<p>Virtual Private network (VPN)</p>
<p>a secure, encrypted connection that allows a device to connect to a network over the internet, masking your IP address and encrypting your internet traffic for enhanced privacy and security. </p>
